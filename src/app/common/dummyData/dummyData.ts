        "content": "Kelvin Kiptum, who set a world-record marathon time this past October at the Chicago Marathon and was expected to contend for gold at this summer’s Olympic Games, died Sunday in a car crash in his home country of Kenya, after his car veered off the road and into a ditch. At just 24 years old, he had run three of the seven fastest marathons ever recorded, including his record 2:00:35 run in Chicago.\n\nBecause of Kiptum’s international celebrity, the tragedy drew headlines around the world. But his death reflects a broader epidemic of preventable car crash deaths in the Global South — a pattern that has intensified in recent years, even as car fatalities in affluent countries have been declining (the US is a notable exception).\n\nLast year, the World Health Organization reported that traffic fatalities had increased by 17 percent in Africa over the past 10 years, even as they fell 5 percent overall worldwide. Road crashes are now one of the top causes of the deaths in a continent contending with plenty of other public health challenges.\n\nThe rise in traffic crashes may partly reflect Africa’s economic growth in recent years. “Part of the reason for increased fatalities in Africa is the increase in the number of vehicles on the roads,” Nhan Tran, who leads the WHO’s safety and mobility unit, told the Guardian in December. “People who were not able to afford a vehicle 10 or 20 years ago can now buy one. Africa has seen a big increase in motorization, but the infrastructure to facilitate it is not there.”\n\nCar crashes and accidental injuries are a public health plague\n\nWorldwide, road traffic crashes kill about 1.2 million people every year, according to the WHO. More than 90 percent of those deaths occur in developing countries, though those countries only have about 60 percent of the world’s vehicles. Pedestrians, motorcyclists, and cyclists, who are especially prevalent in developing countries, are most at risk.\n\nDeaths from preventable injuries more broadly — including not just car crashes but also falls, drownings, workplace accidents, and others — are an increasing focus for public health policy around the world. “One thing that’s been very underreported is the global toll of injuries — occupational injuries, women being burnt with stoves, car crashes,” Lawrence Gostin, director of Georgetown’s O’Neill Institute for National & Global Health Law, told me late last year. “Injuries are probably the most preventable cause of premature deaths in the world.”\n\nAccidents kill more than 3 million people worldwide every year and are a leading cause of death among people under 30. Falls — which include everything from a young child dropping from a height to an elderly person losing their balance — account for nearly 700,000 deaths every year; the WHO has called them “a growing and under-recognized public health issue.”\n\nFailing to prevent these deaths comes with steep economic costs: A 2018 World Bank study concluded that lack of investment in road safety could cost a nation between 7 and 22 percent of its potential GDP growth over a 24-year period. Spending on injury prevention, on the other hand, has been shown to have a very positive return on investment, according to the WHO: Every $1 spent on smoke detectors yields $65 in averted medical costs and increased economic productivity; every $1 spent on improving child vehicle restraints or bicycle helmets saves $29. One program teaching swimming safety in Bangladesh, the WHO reported, was found to create $3,000 in return for every drowning death averted.\n\nNeighboring India is on the vanguard of low and middle income countries prioritizing injury prevention in its public health strategy. In recent decades, India has enjoyed progress in some of its toughest public health challenges. Infant mortality has been steadily dropping since 1990. Fatalities from tuberculosis and diarrhea, two leading causes of death, are also down over the past 30 years.\n\nBut deaths from falls and road injuries in India have increased. A 2022 study found that injuries had an outsize impact on India’s poor, as they were often forced to spend money out of pocket for medical care. A 2023 review of the available research published in the Indian Journal of Community Medicine concluded that traffic injuries are a leading — and increasing — cause of death and disability among the country’s children, reflecting “unregulated urbanization, weak policy in place, and poor awareness of preventive strategies.”\n\nThe paper identified a range of potential interventions supported by research, from low-hanging fruit like increasing public awareness of road safety and promoting the use of seatbelts and helmets, to policy changes such as stricter speed limits, to infrastructure investments including pedestrian lighting and barriers separating pedestrians from roads.\n\nIndia is currently drafting its first national injury prevention strategy — expected to be unveiled ahead of a September global injury prevention summit in Delhi — which could serve as a blueprint for other low and middle income countries confronting similar problems.\n\nA world away, in Ecuador, the city of Quito is the site of an internationally supported effort to make street design improvements at intersections and stretches of roads that are prone to accidents. Similar initiatives are underway across Latin America.\n\nTogether, these efforts mark the beginnings of a more concerted global effort to prevent accidental deaths and injuries — and to make tragic deaths like Kiptum’s less common.",

        "content": "In recent years, we've witnessed a game-changing shift in workplace safety, thanks to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced technologies. As businesses aim for efficiency and fewer accidents, AI is emerging as a formidable ally in reshaping the landscape of occupational safety.\n\nLet's delve into the ways AI is transforming workplace safety through various technologies. Below are some insights shared by Swayam Agrawal, Founder and CEO of Aarika Innovations.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne standout area where AI is making a big impact is predictive analytics. Companies now use machine learning algorithms to analyse past data, identify patterns, and foresee potential safety hazards. These predictive models empower proactive safety measures, reducing the risk of accidents before they happen. Real-time monitoring systems, equipped with sensors and cameras, take this a step further by providing instant feedback and allowing quick intervention when a potential threat arises.\n\nAI-POWERED WEARABLE DEVICES\n\nAI-powered wearable devices are becoming essential tools for safeguarding workers. These wearables, armed with sensors and biometric technology, keep tabs on physiological indicators and environmental conditions. In situations with high levels of toxic gases or extreme temperatures, these devices can issue alerts and even trigger automated safety protocols. This not only ensures the well-being of employees but also cuts down on response times during critical situations.\n\nIn the realm of robotics, AI is revolutionising workplace safety by handling tasks that pose risks to human workers. Autonomous robots, guided by AI algorithms, can navigate hazardous environments, conduct inspections, and manage dangerous materials. This not only minimises human exposure to potential dangers but also enhances the precision and efficiency of safety-related tasks.\n\nCollaborative robots, or cobots, represent another facet of AI reshaping the workplace. These robots work alongside human employees, boosting productivity and safety. Equipped with sensors and AI algorithms, cobots adapt to human movements, avoiding collisions and ensuring a secure working environment. This collaborative approach optimises workflow without compromising safety standards.\n\nAI-DRIVEN VIRTUAL REALITY\n\nThe implementation of AI-driven virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is also contributing to a safer workplace. VR-based training simulations allow employees to experience and navigate potentially dangerous scenarios in a controlled environment. On the other hand, AR overlays digital information onto the real-world environment, offering workers real-time guidance and highlighting potential hazards.\n\nPublished By: Divya Chopra Published On: Feb 10, 2024\n\nTune In",

        "content": "NEW DELHI - The death toll in a firework factory explosion in India has risen to 11 and the two owners have been arrested, the police said on Feb 7, a day after the devastating blast.\n\nDistrict police chief Sanjeev Kumar Kanchan confirmed 11 deaths, while more than 150 people were injured.\n\nThe fiery blast sent chunks of rock and metal flying far from the destroyed factory complex in Harda town, in India’s central Madhya Pradesh state.\n\n“A whole concrete column landed in my property,” said Mr Sargam Jain, who works around 100m from the factory site.\n\n“There was a deafening noise and the earth shook,” said local resident Shanti Jaisani, a lawyer. “We thought a helicopter had crashed in our town.”\n\nFireworks are hugely popular in India, particularly during the Hindu festival of Diwali, as well as for use during wedding celebrations.\n\nExplosions often occur in firecracker workshops in the country.\n\nIn 2019, at least 18 people were killed in a firework factory explosion in Batala in Punjab state, and another 10 were killed in the same year in Bhadohi in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nMany factories fail to stick to basic safety requirements.\n\nState Chief Minister Mohan Yadav has ordered an investigation into the disaster.\n\n“The guilty will be punished,” he said.

        "content": "\n\n\n\n[NEWS IN FOCUS] Why Hyundai is mulling a $3 billion IPO in India\n\nHyundai Motor's expected launch of a $3 billion initial public offering (IPO) in India underscores its robust confidence in the market and its attempt to eye the Southeast Asian country as a new manufacturing hub to replace China and Russia.Hyundai's India unit is planning to list itself on the stock market to raise at least $3 billion later this year, the biggest listing the country has ever seen, according to Bloomberg and other reports.Hyundai is already in talks with several banks including JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley, the reports said, though the company did not confirm it.\"We're reviewing various activities such as the listing of overseas subsidiaries, but nothing has been confirmed,\" Hyundai said Wednesday in a regulatory filing.Established in 1996, Hyundai's Indian subsidiary currently operates two plants in Chennai in Tamil Nadu in the southernmost part of India, with a capacity totaling 850,000 cars a year.The $30 billion IPO will have the potential to hinder the expansion of Tesla in India, but also make Hyundai a bigger competition to Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki, both with a valuation of around $40 billion.Tesla CEO Elon Musk last year said he is eyeing expansion in the Indian market, hinting at the possibility of opening its first EV plant in Gujarat on the western coast of India.Hyundai has been growing rapidly in the Indian market over the past two decades while Ford Motor and General Motors have folded their India business. It previously said it would invest $4 billion in India for 10 years to launch new EVs, charging stations and a battery pack assembly unit.Hyundai is eyeing India as the new manufacturing hub for its EV strategy after the sharp drop in Chinese sales in recent years due to tensions over the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or Thaad.Hyundai last year purchased a factory in Talegaon from General Motors after the U.S. carmaker ceased operations in 2017 amid dropping sales. It is reported to have spent 70 billion Indian rupees ($845 million) on its Talegaon plant to upgrade the infrastructure.Hyundai sold over 600,000 cars in India, an all-time high figure in the 27 years since the Indian subsidiary was formed. It is now in the No. 2 spot behind Maruti Suzuki, according to data from the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.As a country with the world’s largest population, India has the world’s third-largest auto market after China and the United States and ahead of Japan. Around 4.85 million vehicles were sold in India alone in 2022, up 28.3 percent.Hyundai Motor shares closed 245,000 won, up 4 percent from the previous trading day.BY SARAH CHEA [chea.sarah@joongang.co.kr]",

        "content": "In a tragic incident that unfolded on February 6, a 48-year-old worker met a gruesome end at a Schreiber Foods facility in Carthage, Missouri. The man fell into an automated palleting machine, becoming ensnared in its relentless mechanism. Despite swift response from colleagues and emergency personnel, the severity of his injuries led to profuse bleeding. The man was pronounced dead at the scene, unable to be airlifted to a hospital in time.\n\nAdvertisment\n\nThe incident, which occurred around 3:40 p.m., triggered an immediate response from first responders and local law enforcement. Given the gravity of the accident, there is an expectation of a federal investigation spearheaded by workplace safety investigators to understand what led to such a tragic event.\n\nThe Town and the Company\n\nCarthage, where the facility is located, is nestled about 140 miles south of Kansas City. Home to around 15,000 residents, this town is now the backdrop of a somber narrative. Schreiber Foods, the company at the heart of the incident, is renowned for its production of a wide variety of food products. Its offerings span cream cheese, natural cheese, processed cheese, beverages, yogurt, and even plant-based alternatives. The company's presence is not limited to Missouri, it operates facilities across the United States and extends to countries like Mexico, Brazil, India, and several European nations.\n\nAttempts to solicit comments from Schreiber Foods and the U.S. Department of Labor have gone unanswered. The identity of the deceased worker has been withheld, and a public statement from the company remains absent.",

The trials were facilitated by the South Central Railway to achieve safety in train operations across Indian Railways. It is a state-of-the-art electronic system with Safety Integrity Level-4 (SIL-4) standards.
